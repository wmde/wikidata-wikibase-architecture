# Glossary

This section contains the most important domain and technical terms used when discussing the system.
The goal is for all consumers of the architecture documentation to have an identical understanding of the terms and not use synonyms and homonyms.

## Stakeholder

All persons, roles or organizations that:

- will use the system
- should know the architecture
- have to work with the architecture or with code
- need the documentation of the architecture for their work
- have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

## Use case

A textual description of the functionality provided by the system that captures actor-system interaction. It specifies how a user interacts with a system and how the system responds to the user actions.

## Component

A component is a software unit with a well-defined interface and explicitly specified dependencies. A software component can be as small as a block of reusable code, or it can be as big as an entire application depending on the level of granularity a system is being looked at.

## [MediaWiki Extension](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Extensions)

Extensions are software components that administrators can add (or remove) to their MediaWiki application in order to customize how it looks and works.
Examples: WikibaseClient, UniversalLanguageSelector, OAuth

## [WikibaseClient](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Wikibase_Client)

WikibaseClient is a [MediaWiki Extension](#mediawiki-extension) that enables the use and display of Entity data from a [Wikibase Repository](#wikibase-repository) via Lua modules or parser functions. Clients can also use centralized language links.

## Wikibase Repository

Wikibase Repository is an application that provides structured [Entity](#entity) data. Its core functionality is implemented as a [MediaWiki extension](#mediawiki-extension) called [WikibaseRepo](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Wikibase_Repository). It can optionally contain additional [Wikibase extensions](#wikibase-extension) such as WikibaseLexeme.

## Wikibase Extension

Wikibase Extensions are MediaWiki extensions that add further functionality to Wikibase. They depend on the Wikibase extension being installed and directly interact with it.
Examples: WikibaseLexeme, WikibaseMediaInfo, WikibaseImport

## Entity

Entities are the top level concepts of Wikibase's data model. Items and Properties are the core Entity types of Wikibase. Other types can be added through [Wikibase extensions](#wikibase-extension), such as [Lexemes](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:WikibaseLexeme/Data_Model#Lexeme).

## [Item](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Items)

In Wikidata, Items are used to represent all the things in human knowledge, including topics, concepts, and objects. For example, the "1988 Summer Olympics", "love", "Elvis Presley", and "gorilla" are all Items in Wikidata.

## [Property](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Properties)

Properties are Entities that describe a relationship between Items (or other Entities) and values of the Property. Typical Properties are _population_ (using numbers as values), _binomial name_ (using strings as values), but also _has father_ and _author of_ (both using Items as values).

## [Sitelink](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:Sitelinks)

Sitelinks (also known as interwiki links or interlanguage links) are special links that contain a site and a title, and go from individual [Items](#item) in Wikidata to pages on other Wikimedia sites such as Wikipedia, Wikisource and Wikivoyage.

## [Interwiki Links](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Interwiki)

Interwiki links are links to pages of other projects, using a prefixed internal link style.
Interwiki links make it possible to link to pages of (e.g.) Wikipedia, Wikibooks, Wikinews etc. or to your wiki-project in different languages.

## [Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lua)

Lua is a programming language that can be embedded into [Wikitext](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikitext) to programmatically enhance the content of wiki articles. It is available on most Wikimedia sites (Wikipedias, Commons, Wiktionaries, ...) via the [Scribunto MediaWiki extension](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Scribunto). It's often used in templates for [Infoboxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Infobox) on Wikipedias.

## [Wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext)

Wikitext, also known as Wiki markup or Wikicode, consists of the syntax and keywords used by the MediaWiki software to format a page. It's what editors work with to create and edit wiki articles.

## Wikitext-generated content

This describes the content of a wiki that is generated by [Wikitext](#wikitext), such as wiki pages or [messages](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:System_message).

## [MediaWiki Core](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Core)

MediaWiki Core refers to all files that are part of the main MediaWiki package.

## [Special Page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Special_pages)

Special pages are dynamically created MediaWiki pages, which perform a specific function, such as providing a list of pages, showing statistics or creating a form for user submitted feedback. They are located in their own namespace (_Special:_) and are not editable directly like other pages.  Developers can create new special pages. They will generally show up in the list of all special pages at [Special:SpecialPages](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:SpecialPages).
