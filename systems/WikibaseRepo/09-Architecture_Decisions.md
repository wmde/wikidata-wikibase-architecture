# Architecture Decisions

## ADRs

Since 2018 architecture decisions concerning Wikibase are recorded as ADRs. They are stored within the Wikibase code repository and can be found on the [official documentation website](https://doc.wikimedia.org/Wikibase/master/php/md_docs_adr_index.html).

## Early architecture decisions

This section contains retrospectively documented decisions that were made before the practice of recording them in ADRs was established. Some knowledge of the decision context likely went missing over time, so the reasoning is speculative to some degree.
