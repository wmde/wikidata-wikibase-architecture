# Architecture Constraints

## [MediaWiki Extensions](../overview/12-Glossary.md#mediawiki-extension)

Any functionality that doesn't belong in [MediaWiki core](../overview/12-Glossary.md#mediawiki-core) has to be registered as a mediawiki extension.
**Mediawiki extensions cannot have extensions of their own.**
