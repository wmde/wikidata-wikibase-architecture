# Glossary Scope

**Decision Date:** February 2021

**Summary:** A single glossary would be used for terms from all systems.

## Details

We initially started our effort with a glossary defined per system (including a top level system glossary).

Through time we aligned on wanting to use the same language across systems and components, to avoid different terms meaning different things in different contexts.
