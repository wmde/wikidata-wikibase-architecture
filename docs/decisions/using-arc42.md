# Using arc42

**Decision Date:** End of 2020

**Summary:** Use the [arc42 template](https://docs.arc42.org/home/) to document the architecture of Wikidata/Wikibase.

## Details

The [arc42 template](https://docs.arc42.org/home/) for documenting architecture was suggested to us by thePHPcc whom we worked with.
We liked the template's structure and we didn't have any alternative templates in mind, so we went with it.  
Later we established the systems we want to document are too big and we can benefit from using the template several times throughout the docs. This is why each system (e.g. Wikibase Client, Wikibase Repository) uses its own arc42 template.

:::warning
The Overview section does not have the full arc42 structure on purpose! It contains only the parts that make sense for providing overview of the Wikidata/Wikibase ecosystem (like Architecture Constraints, Context and Scope, and Glossary).
