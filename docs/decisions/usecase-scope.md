# Usecase Scope

**Decision Date:** End of 2020

**Summary:** Focus on primary usecases that drove development, rather than other usecases we see today.

## Details

We initially want to focus on the primary usecases that drove the development of the system as a whole, individual components and connections between components.

We will need to revisit some of the more granular usecases at various levels at a later date.

For example: Individual editing usecases, rather than editing data in general.
