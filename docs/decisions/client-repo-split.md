# Split documentation for client(s) and repo

**Decision Date:** End of 2020

**Summary:** We will have separate arc42 documentation for [Wikibase Client](../../systems/overview/12-Glossary.md#wikibase-client) and [Wikibase Repository](../../systems/overview/12-Glossary.md#wikibase-repository).

## Details

Within the [Wikidata](../../systems/overview/12-Glossary.md#wikidata) context there are two types of systems:

- The Wikibase Repository (Wikidata) storing and providing structured data
- Various Wikibase Clients (Wikipedias, Wiktionaries, ...) consuming the data provided by Wikidata.

Since both the Wikibase Clients and the Wikibase Repository each have different requirements, constraints, and stakeholders, we decided to split the documentation for the sake of clarity.

While Wikimedia Commons is also a Wikibase Repository, it is not considered the primary focus for the documentation at this time.

The documentation of Wikibase Repository will mainly refer to Wikidata.
