# Split documentation for client(s) and repo

**Decision Date:** End of 2020

**Summary:** We will have separate arc42 documentation for clients and repo.

## Details

Within the Wikidata context there are two types of systems:

- The structured data repository (Wikidata) storing and providing structured data
- Clients (Wikipedias, Wiktionaries, ...) consuming the data provided by Wikidata.

Since both clients and the repo each have different requirements, constraints, and stakeholders, we decided to split the documentation for the sake of clarity.

While Wikimedia Commons is also a repository, it is not considered the primary focus for the documentation at this time.

The documentation of the repository system will mainly refer to Wikidata.
