# Concepts Scope

**Decision Date:** February 2021

**Summary:** A single Concepts section in Overview would be used for all systems.

## Details

The section Concepts (or crosscutting concepts) is a part of the [arc42 template](https://docs.arc42.org/section-8/). It aims to describe overall, principal regulations and solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts of the system (e.g. domain model, design patterns, technical decisions).

We think the contents of that section will be applicable for most documented systems, because as of now there is one Wikidata team which follows the same principals and it's expected that those principals are reflected in all systems the team works on. That's why we decided to have only one such section in the Overview instead of one in each system we document.
