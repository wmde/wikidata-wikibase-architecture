### Wikidata Product Manager

- Store structured data for Wikipedia / Wikimedia projects in a central place (Initially sitelinks and infoboxes)
- It should be possible to create lists from the stored structured data.
- Make the centralized data not only useful for Wikimedia projects, but also other users (researchers, apps etc.)
- Store structured data relevant to the Wiktionary project in a meaningful way, that will also be useful for Abstract Wikipedia.
- Store structured data relevant to files on Commons.
- The stored data and changes must be managable by a distributed community.
- Solution should not enforce too tight rigidity in the data (e.g. enforcing and supporting by automation symmetric properties) because “world is complex and there are always exceptions”

### Wikibase Product Manager

- People outside of WIkimedia are able to create knowledge bases similar to Wikidata using our same software stack.
- It is easy to write tools and scripts that work for both Wikidata and other Wikibases.
- I can replicate the Wikidata experience on a non Wikimedia Wikibase.
- I can used the same Wikidata ontology on a non Wikimedia Wikibase.
